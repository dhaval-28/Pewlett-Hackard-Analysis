# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Analysis Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. The first deliverable includes information such as employee number, first and last name, position title, and start and end date. The second deliverable includes employee number, first and last name, birth date, start and end date, and position title.

### Key Takeaways :
From these tables, we can see that there are four key takeaways:
(1) Among employees which are retiring, there 1549 employees who qualify for the mentorship program. 
(2) The number of employees retiring are more than potential mentors. This would create a challenge for a company to train new employees.
(3) Almost one third of retiring employees are Senior Engineers, another one third are the Senior Staff and the rest are all others.
(4) Company will have to train and fill Senior Engineers and Senior staff positions with the greatest priority.

## Summary
### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
To determine how many rolls need to be filled, we will need to create a table/graph to categorize the retirees by different age groups and title. Each year company can hire the same number of employees that would be retiring by age group. We have a list of employees who were born between 1952 and 1955. Company would need to hire different number of employees every year based on employees hitting the retirement age by age group. 

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
The projected number of employees retiring in next 4 years are almost 90,000 while only 1549 of them are eligible to become mentor.  Also, all employees who are eligible for mentorship after retirement might not be interested in mentorship. So, there are not enough retirees to mentor the next generation of employees. We can create a query which provides employees eligible for mentorship with specific roles/titles.  This will help company plan mentorship program better.
